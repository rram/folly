Building this package
=====================
This build process assumes you have cowbuilder and git-buildpackage.

First you'll need to do some setup:
```
DIST=trusty git-pbuilder create --components "main universe"
git clone https://github.com/reddit/folly.git
```

If you already have the repo from a previous build, make sure it's up to date:
```
git checkout upstream
git pull
```

Make a new release:
```
export RELEASE=0.55.0  # Replace this with the release number
git checkout ubuntu/trusty
git merge v$RELEASE
dch -v $RELEASE-0reddit1
# Update the control and install files; make any packaging changes necessary
git commit -va -m 'Package release v$RELEASE'
gbp buildpackage --git-pristine-tar --git-pristine-tar-commit --git-upstream-tag='v%(version)s' --git-pbuilder --git-dist=trusty --git-debian-branch=ubuntu/trusty
```

Test that the new package works. Once you're done, make a pull request.

One day, jenkins will take it from here. Until then, push the final package out
to the repo. To build a source package, you'll need to get the orig.tar.gz:
```
git checkout pristine-tar
pristine-tar checkout folly_$RELEASE.orig.tar.gz
mv folly_$RELEASE.orig.tar.gz ..
git checkout ubuntu/trusty
debuild -S
```
